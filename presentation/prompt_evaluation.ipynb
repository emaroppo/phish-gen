We're thinking about going to a local restaurant and having dinner with some drinks afterwards.  I'm thinking it might be fun.  I'd like to invite you and your family.  I'll send you an invite later.  I'm thinking about sending you an invitation via email.  I'll send you an email with the details of the party.  Let me know if you're interested.  I'd love to hear your thoughts.  Thanks, and I hope you have a great holiday.  See you soon.\n",
